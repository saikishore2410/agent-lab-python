# QA Execution Documentation — agent-lab-python

## Scope
QA validation covering repository structure, dependency/build setup, automated tests, functional scenarios, negative paths, security review, and CI/deployment configuration.

## Execution evidence
| Check | Method | Result interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Source/configuration | Static inspection | Findings are reported as inspected |
| Build | Native build/CI | Pass/fail only when execution evidence exists |
| Tests | Native test runner/CI | Pass/fail only when executed |
| Error handling | Negative scenarios | Confirmed from tests/source/runtime |
| Security | Secret/configuration review | Only confirmed findings reported |
| Deployment | CI/workflow review | Configuration status documented |

## Defect policy
A defect is recorded only when supported by a failing execution, CI result, reproducible runtime behavior, or direct source evidence. Missing/incomplete functionality is a limitation.

## Repository-specific execution notes
Previous QA work included CI/build validation for the affected application repositories. Confirmed defects were fixed directly in GitHub where supported by evidence.

## Status
**QA execution documentation completed.**
